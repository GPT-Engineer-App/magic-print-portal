Create a professional yet fun website for a business called "Magic Print Production," which showcases all the books I have created and uploaded to Amazon KDP. The website should have a sleek, elegant theme with a color scheme of black and shiny gold (not yellow). I already have a logo that should be prominently featured on the homepage. 

Key requirements:
1. **Homepage:** 
   - Display the logo at the top.
   - Include a brief introduction about Magic Print Production.
   - Highlight featured books with their covers, titles, and short descriptions.

2. **Books Section:** 
   - A dedicated page listing all books with thumbnails, titles, authors (if applicable), and short descriptions.
   - Each book should have a link to its Amazon KDP page.
   - Option to categorize books by genre or series.

3. **About Us:** 
   - A page with information about the business, its mission, and the story behind Magic Print Production.

4. **Contact Us:**
   - A contact form for inquiries.
   - Include social media links and an email address.

5. **Design Specifications:**
   - Use a black background with shiny gold accents for text, buttons, and borders.
   - Ensure the site is mobile-friendly and easy to navigate.
   - Use elegant, legible fonts that complement the black and gold theme.

6. **Additional Features:**
   - A blog or news section for updates about new releases and author insights.
   - An email newsletter signup form.

Please make sure the website is user-friendly, visually appealing, and reflects the luxurious and professional aesthetic of Magic Print Production.
